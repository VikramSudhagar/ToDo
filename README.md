# ToDo App
This ToDo App was created by me, Vikram Sudhagar. The ToDo App API was created using GoLang, using the GoFiber Framework. The frontend was created with Javascript, HTML and CSS. Additional frameworks used were Redis for session storage, and PostgreSQL for the database, to store the ToDo Tasks, and Users. The ToDo App uses Argon2Id hashing to ensure security for the user passwords. Currently, the user has the option to add and delete tasks.
